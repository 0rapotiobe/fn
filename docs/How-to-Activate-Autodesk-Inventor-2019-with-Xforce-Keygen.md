## What are the features of Autodesk Inventor 2019?
 
Autodesk Inventor 2019 is not just a software for 3D modeling, it also offers a range of features that can help you improve your design process, productivity, and collaboration. Here are some of the features of Autodesk Inventor 2019 that you should know about:

- **Parametric, direct, freeform, and rules-based design capabilities**: You can choose the best approach for your design task, whether it is sketching and constraining, pushing and pulling geometry, sculpting organic shapes, or defining parameters and logic. You can also switch between different design modes as needed.
- **Integrated tools for sheet metal, frame design, tube and pipe, cable & harness, presentations, rendering, simulation, machine design, and more**: You can create and document various types of mechanical designs with specialized tools that are integrated with the core modeling environment. You can also perform analysis and testing of your designs with simulation tools that support stress, dynamics, thermal, and motion studies.
- **TrustedDWG compatibility and powerful Model-Based Definition capabilities**: You can work seamlessly with AutoCAD users and other CAD applications with the TrustedDWG technology that ensures data fidelity and compatibility. You can also embed manufacturing information directly in the 3D model with Model-Based Definition (MBD) tools that support GD&T, annotations, dimensions, and tolerances.
- **Cloud-based design review and collaboration**: You can share your designs with key stakeholders and collect feedback from anywhere using cloud-based design review. You can also work with anyone, no matter what CAD software they use, with AnyCAD technology that supports native file formats. You can also access your data from any device with Autodesk Drive.
- **Design automation powered by iLogic**: You can satisfy demands for custom products and automate common tasks with iLogic. You can create rules and parameters that drive your design logic and generate multiple configurations of your models. You can also access Inventor API to create add-ins or use Forge Design Automation API to run job processes in the cloud.
- **BIM interoperability**: You can increase your sales opportunities while participating in BIM projects with BIM interoperability tools. You can use data exchanges for a highly collaborative workflow when creating custom fabrications around Revit data. You can also include necessary authoring metadata and export your designs to a BIM-ready Revit format.

These are just some of the features of Autodesk Inventor 2019 that can help you create better products faster and easier. To learn more about Autodesk Inventor 2019, you can visit the official website [^1^] or download a free trial [^2^].
