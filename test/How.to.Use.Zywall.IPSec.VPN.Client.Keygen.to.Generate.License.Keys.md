But what if you don't have a license key or you want to extend your trial period? In that case, you might be tempted to use a keygen program that claims to generate valid license keys for Zywall IPSec VPN Client. A keygen is a software that creates random serial numbers or activation codes for various applications. However, using a keygen for Zywall IPSec VPN Client is not only illegal but also risky. Here are some reasons why you should avoid using a keygen for Zywall IPSec VPN Client:
 
- **It is a violation of the software license agreement.** By using a keygen, you are breaking the terms and conditions of the software license agreement that you agreed to when you installed the software. This could result in legal consequences, such as fines or lawsuits, from the software developer or owner.
- **It could compromise your security and privacy.** A keygen program could contain malware, such as viruses, trojans, spyware, or ransomware, that could infect your computer and steal your personal or financial information. Moreover, a keygen-generated license key could be detected by the software or the VPN server and expose your identity and activity online.
- **It could damage your computer or the software.** A keygen program could also corrupt your system files or registry entries, causing errors, crashes, or performance issues. Additionally, a keygen-generated license key could interfere with the proper functioning of the software or the VPN connection, resulting in poor quality, instability, or disconnection.

Therefore, it is highly recommended that you do not use a keygen for Zywall IPSec VPN Client. Instead, you should purchase a legitimate license key from the official website or authorized resellers. This way, you can enjoy the full features and benefits of the software without any risk or hassle. You can also contact the customer support team if you have any questions or issues regarding the software or the license key.
